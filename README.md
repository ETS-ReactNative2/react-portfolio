# Description
A portfolio website to showcase my abilities and previously built projects for potential employers or 
customers. The design is migrated from a previous 1-page static website using native HTML5, CSS3 and ES6
into a modularized React app with conditionally rendered components to create a seamless experience in a
single page application (SPA)

Although being published under a permissive [MIT license](#license), the high level of customization of 
this project makes it of little use to others outside of downloading the repo as a starter template so
sections on installation and usage will be excluded for this particular documentation
